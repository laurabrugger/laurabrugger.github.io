Spatial analysis of Hurricane Heleneâ€™s impact on voter turnout patterns.

<!--more-->

This project uses advanced GIS and spatial analysis to examine how Hurricane Helene influenced voter turnout during the 2024 U.S. election, focusing on communities affected by climate-related extreme weather. By integrating disaster intensity data with demographic and electoral information, the research identifies barriers to democratic participation created by climate-driven events. These insights support the development of resilience strategies that promote equitable access to voting infrastructure during future climate crises.

Supported by the [Geospatial Research Initiative's 2025 Seed Grant Program](https://geospatial.wustl.edu/announcing-the-2025-seed-grant-recipients/), this study contributes to understanding the intersection of climate events and democratic participation.
