Study to investigate election infrastructure and administrative burden amid severe weather events. 

<!--more-->

This project examines how severe weather events and natural disasters disrupt election infrastructure and administrative processes, potentially creating barriers to political participation and exacerbating existing inequalities. Using spatial and temporal data on polling locations, voter turnout, and demographic factors, the work aims to reveal how these disruptions affect access to voting and civic engagement.

By identifying spatial patterns of political inequality linked to disaster exposure, this research supports developing resilience strategies that maintain democratic participation and equitable access to election infrastructure amid climate-related crises.
