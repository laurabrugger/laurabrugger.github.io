This collaborative initiative aims to advance equitable and resilient solutions to water challenges in the St. Louis region. As a contributing member, I engage with interdisciplinary experts to explore innovative approaches addressing local water issues. Our collective efforts focus on integrating scientific research with community needs to promote sustainable water management practices.
