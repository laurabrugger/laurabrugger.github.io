This emerging project aims to investigate how extreme weather events and climate stressors impact urban wildlife populations and the ecosystem services they provide. By examining these dynamics alongside social and environmental factors, the work seeks to inform urban conservation and resilience strategies that support both biodiversity and community well-being.

## Preliminary Exploration: iNaturalist Heatmaps

This exploratory mapping examines how St. Louis residents engaged with nature through iNaturalist observations before and after major weather disruptions, using the May 2025 tornado as a case study. Because iNaturalist records are community-generated, they capture both access to biodiversity and patterns of human activity. By tracking changes in observation density, taxa reported, and observer locations, this work explores how climate disruptions influence urban residentsâ€™ interactions with, and equitable access to, nature.
