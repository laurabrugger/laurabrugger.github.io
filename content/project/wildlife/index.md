This emerging project aims to investigate how extreme weather events and climate stressors impact urban wildlife populations and the ecosystem services they provide. By examining these dynamics alongside social and environmental factors, the work seeks to inform urban conservation and resilience strategies that support both biodiversity and community well-being.

## Preliminary Exploration: iNaturalist Heatmaps

This exploratory mapping investigates how St. Louis residents engaged with nature through [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations) community-generated observations before and after major weather disruptions.

We focus on the [May 16, 2025 tornado](https://www.weather.gov/lsx/05_16_2025) as a case study of a significant weather disruption. Since iNaturalist data reflect both biodiversity presence and human observation patterns, analyzing changes in observation density, reported taxa, and observer locations provides insights into how climate events may influence urban residentsâ€™ interactions with nature and equitable access to green spaces.

*Note: These early visualizations are heuristic tools designed to guide future spatial modeling, field surveys, and community engagement rather than provide definitive conclusions.*

### Next Steps

Future work will integrate environmental, social, and ecological data to understand how extreme weather impacts urban wildlife and communities. Our goal is to guide climate resilience strategies that strengthen both ecosystems and the communities they support.
