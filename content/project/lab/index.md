GIS analysis of polling place changes and transportation disruptions around Hurricane Helene. 

<!--more-->

This project examines how severe weather events and natural disasters disrupt critical infrastructure supporting voting access—focusing on polling place changes and transportation disruptions. It uses spatial and temporal data to identify how these disruptions may create barriers to political participation and exacerbate existing inequalities. The research aims to inform resilience strategies that ensure equitable voting access during climate-related crises.

As part of this broader study, I supervised a summer undergraduate research initiative, supported by WashU’s Center for the Environment, which focused on analyzing spatial data related to polling place changes and transportation disruptions during Hurricane Helene. This project contributed valuable insights into infrastructure vulnerabilities affecting democratic participation.
