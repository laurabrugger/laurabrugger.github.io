## About My Work

Dr. Laura Brugger (she/her) is a climate and socio-environmental scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. Her work focuses on understanding how climate and environmental change affect ecosystems and communities, and how rigorous, data-driven analysis can inform practical decisions under climate stress. She uses spatial analysis, GIS, and climate-risk modeling to integrate environmental and social data and produce decision-relevant insights that support climate adaptation, conservation, and resilience planning. Her recent projects examine disaster risk, environmental exposure, and ecosystem resilience, with applications spanning climate risk assessment, nature-based solutions, and policy-relevant research. Laura leads interdisciplinary research initiatives and collaborates with government and nonprofit partners to translate complex analyses into applied outputs, including maps, briefs, and peer-reviewed publications. She also serves on the Board of the [Missouri Coalition for the Environment](https://moenvironment.org/), supporting advocacy for clean water, clean air, clean energy, and a healthy environment in Missouri.
