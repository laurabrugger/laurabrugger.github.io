## About My Work

Dr. Laura Brugger (she/her) is a soio-environmental researcher at Washington University in St. Louis. Her work examines the interconnectedness of natural and human systems in the context of climate change, with a focus on socio-ecological resilience, adaptation, and the integration of climate and conservation policy. She uses spatial analysis and climate-hazards modeling to translate complex environmental and social data into actionable insights that support equitable, community-driven strategies and environmental justice. Her recent projects investigate disparities in climate vulnerability and resilience, as well as how disasters and environmental risks affect communities and democratic participation. Outside of her research, Laura serves on the Board of the [Missouri Coalition for the Environment](https://moenvironment.org/), supporting advocacy for clean water, clean air, clean energy, and a healthy environment in Missouri.
