## About Me

I'm Laura! I grew up on a small family farm in rural Nebraska, where summers spent watching frogs at the creek sparked a lifelong curiosity about the natural world. That led me to attend the University of Nebraska–Lincoln as a first-generation college student, and after several years working in the nonprofit sector, I chose to pursue graduate school to better explore how we can protect and care for our world and its people. Now more than ever, I believe in the critical work of building sustainable solutions that uplift both people and the planet—something I’m honored to do in both my personal and professional life. In my free time, you'll find me hiking (especially around volcanoes), taking my dog Stevie on adventures, exploring the outdoors, and spending time with loved ones.
