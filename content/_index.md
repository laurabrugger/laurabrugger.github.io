      title: '🌍 My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        My work focuses on understanding climate risk and environmental change across coupled human–environment systems, with an emphasis on producing applied, decision-relevant insights. I use spatial analysis, GIS, and climate-risk modeling to examine how climate stressors shape ecosystems, environmental exposure, and resilience. My early research examined disaster risk and its implications for resilience and public decision-making. More recent and ongoing work spans ecosystem-focused applications, including biodiversity, urban ecology, and nature-based solutions, with projects ranging from urban wildlife and green infrastructure to climate-relevant land and forest systems. Across these efforts, I collaborate with interdisciplinary teams and partners to translate rigorous analysis into practical outputs—maps, briefs, and syntheses—that support climate adaptation, conservation planning, and ecosystem resilience in a changing climate.
