      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        I am a socio-environmental scientist focused on the dynamic relationship between people and the planet. My early work examined how disasters and social vulnerability influence civic participation and resilience. More recently, I have expanded into biodiversity and public health, with projects on urban wildlife and tropical forest conservation. Across these strands, I translate rigorous research into actionable, equitable strategies that help communities and ecosystems thrive, especially in the face of climate change.
