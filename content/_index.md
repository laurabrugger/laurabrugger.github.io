        I am a socio-environmental scientist focused on the dynamic relationship between people and the planet. My work examines how human well-being and environmental health can be mutually reinforcing, especially in the face of climate change. I use rigorous, actionable research to develop equitable, science-based strategies that help both communities and ecosystems thrive.
