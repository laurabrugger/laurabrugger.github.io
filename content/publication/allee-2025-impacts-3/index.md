  This brief presents findings about how the City of St.
  Louis GBI Pilot Program positively impacted
  participants’ quality of life, including the ability to
  meet daily living expenses, the well-being of
  participants and their children, and the quality of
  their relationships. We also examined participants’
  feelings about the GBI program and the way that it
  affected their lives. This is the third in a series of
  three briefs. Briefs 1 and 2 focus on economic
  security and credit health, respectively.
