  Guaranteed Basic Income (GBI)
  programs aim to offset the effects of
  poverty in low-income families,
  provide reliable income streams that
  can help families reach their
  financial goals, and supplement gaps
  in the existing social safety net. These
  programs provide unrestricted, regular cash
  transfers that people can use in whatever way best
  meets their individual economic circumstances.
  Evidence suggests that GBI can improve food
  insecurity, increase savings, reduce debt,
  and positively impact subjective financial well-being.
  This brief presents findings about how the City of St.
  Louis GBI Pilot Program impacted the economic
  security of participants, including their experience
  of economic hardships, their use of the payments,
  their financial goals, and their overall financial wellbeing. This is the first in a series of three briefs.
  Briefs 2 and 3 focus on credit health and quality of
  life, respectively.
