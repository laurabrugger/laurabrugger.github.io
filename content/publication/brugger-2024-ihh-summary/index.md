abstract: |
  The "In Her Hands" guaranteed income initiative represents a pioneering approach to addressing
  economic disparities faced by communities impacted by racial injustice and historic marginalization,
  particularly Black women in Georgia. The program has two stated goals: “to support Black women
  experiencing financial insecurity in Georgia to achieve greater financial stability and overcome wealth
  decelerators” and “generate and disseminate insights to promote more racially inclusive, just, and
  sustainable social safety net models and policies in the U.S.” This executive summary outlines the key
  findings and implications from the program's first year, highlighting its impact on participants' financial
  stability, asset development, health, and overall well-being.
