  In this brief, we use data from the Census Household Pulse survey to examine how a representative sample of CTC-eligible American
  families making less than $150,000 a year report using their CTC payments. This survey was administered between July 21st and
  August 16th, covering the period in which the first two CTC payments were deposited in familiesâ€™ bank accounts.
