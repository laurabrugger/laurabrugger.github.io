  Objective: To estimate differences in mental distress, sleep quality, and sleep duration following twelve and twenty-four months of receipt of guaranteed income (GI) between program participants and a comparison group.

  Methods: We conducted a community-engaged intervention study (In Her Hands) between 2022-2024 in Georgia, United States. Participants included self-identified Black women with income â‰¤ 200% of the federal poverty level who participated in follow-up surveys (12-month participation rates: intervention: 40.8%; control: 11.9%). GI recipients were selected via lottery; comparison participants were those not selected at baseline who completed follow-up surveys. We measured mental distress using the Kessler-10 and sleep quality and duration via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at 12- and 24-months following enrollment. We fit linear regression models using generalized estimating equations, accounting for site, age, and wave to estimate differences and 95% confidence intervals.

  Results: We include 468 GI recipients and 374 controls (99.93% Black; mean age 37.0 years, median annual income: $11,400). Following 12 and 24 months of GI receipt, GI recipients reported improved sleep quality (24 month difference in PSQI score, -1.33 (-1.83, -0.82)) and reduced mental distress (24 month K10 difference: -3.99 (-5.45, -2.52)) but not significant differences in sleep duration (24 month difference: 0.22 (-0.15, 0.60).

  Conclusions: At 12 and 24 months of GI, intervention participants reported higher sleep quality and lower mental distress compared to a comparison group.
