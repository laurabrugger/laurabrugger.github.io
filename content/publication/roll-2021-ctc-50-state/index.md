abstract: |
  The temporary expansion of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) is projected to cut American child poverty by more than half. The CTC expansion provides families with $3,600 for every child in the      household under the age of six and $3,000 for every child between the ages of six and 17. The vast majority of U.S. families with children are eligible for the CTC. In this brief, we use      data from the Census Household Pulse survey to examine how a representative sample of CTC-eligible families making less than $150,000 a year report using their payments. This survey was       administered between July 21st and August 16th, covering the period in which the first two CTC payments were deposited in families’ bank account. These fact sheets include key data on CTC     receipt, payment usage, and changes in families’ food security after the payments went out. This report is currently composed of one national overview brief, 50 state briefs and a             Washington D.C. brief. Puerto Rico and other territories are not included because while they are eligible for the expanded CTC, there is no provision for them to file for or receive advance   payments.
