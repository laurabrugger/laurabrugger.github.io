abstract: |
  The United States has witnessed an alarming surge in billion-dollar disasters, setting a record for the
  number experienced in a single year. These climate-related events, ranging from wildfires to hurricanes,
  are not just increasing in frequency and cost; they disproportionately impact minority communities.
  Systemic inequalities have left these communities more vulnerable to the physical and socio-economic
  repercussions of natural disasters, thereby exacerbating existing disparities. This intersection of climate
  events and voter suppression efforts has created a multifaceted dynamic, where vulnerable populations
  not only bear the brunt of environmental challenges but also face additional hurdles in exercising their
  right to vote. Although prior research acknowledges the influence of natural disasters and social
  vulnerability on voting disparities, limited studies have investigated how these relationships may vary
  across different geographic areas. Further, while many studies have focused on characteristics related to
  vulnerability and the corresponding relationship to voter turnout, more holistic measures that encompass
  broader dimensions of social vulnerability have not yet been explored. Finally, existing literature has
  primarily focused on negative relationships of disasters and vulnerability on voting behavior. Limited
  attention has been given to the potential mitigating role of environmental resilience. The purpose of this
  study is to examine the spatial heterogeneity that may exist in the relationships between disasters, social
  vulnerability, environmental resilience, and changes in voter turnout. Specifically, this study uses
  geographically weighted regression to examine the following research questions: 1) To what extent were
  disaster events (hurricane, tropical storm, flood, etc.) related to changes in national voter turnout between
  the 2016 and 2020 Presidential Elections?; 2) How did a comprehensive measure of social vulnerability
  relate to changes in national voter turnout between the 2016 and 2020 Presidential Elections?; 3) How was environmental resilience related to changes in national voter turnout between the 2016 and 2020
  Presidential Elections?; and 4) What spatial heterogeneity exists in the above relationships? Using
  national voter turnout data from Harvard Dataverse and American Community Survey Data, Federal
  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) disaster declaration data, the Social Vulnerability Index, and
  the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) index, this study observes that spatial
  heterogeneity exists in these relationships. By revealing how these relationships may vary across different
  geographies, this study offers insights for policymakers seeking to safeguard voting rights amid a quickly
  changing climate.

summary: >
  This study examines how disasters, social vulnerability, and environmental resilience are spatially related to changes in voter turnout between the 2016 and 2020 U.S. Presidential Elections, revealing geographic variation in these dynamics and offering insights for protecting voting rights in the face of climate change.
