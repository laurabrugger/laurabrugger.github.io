abstract: |
  As rates of vaccination have slowed, concerns are growing about how
  to increase vaccine uptake among those who are vaccine hesitant,
  particularly with the emergence of new and contagious variants such
  as Delta. Using our national Socioeconomic Impacts of COVID-19
  Survey, we examine the predictors of vaccine hesitance in the U.S. and
  report on findings from an experiment assessing the potential impacts
  of vaccine incentive schemes.
