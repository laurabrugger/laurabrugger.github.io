abstract: |
  The 2021 temporary expansion of the child tax credit (CTC) was unprecedented in its reach, lifting 3.7 million children out of poverty as of December 2021. It provided families with up to     $3,600 for every child in the household under the age of six, and up to $3,000 for every child between the ages of 6 and 17. Half the credit was issued monthly between July and December,      2021. Almost all middle- and low-income families with children were eligible for the CTC. Married parents making less than $150,000 and single parents making less than $112,500 per year       were eligible to receive the full amount of the credit, which began to phase out slowly after these income cut-offs. The purpose of this study is to understand the impact of the expanded      CTC on families and to inform current proposals to make the credit permanent.
