abstract: |
  The 2021 expanded Child Tax Credit (CTC) provided temporary enhancements to the existing CTC for the tax years 2021 and 2022. Under the expanded credit, families with children under the age   of 18 were eligible to receive a credit of up to $3,000 per child ($3,600 for children under the age of 6). In addition, half the credit was paid out on a monthly basis rather than as a    one-  time payment at tax time. This provision was designed to provide more immediate financial support to families with children during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it also supported     families who were at higher risk of financial strain, such as those raising children with disabilities. In this report, we use a nationally representative survey of US families to explore the   impacts of the CTC on families raising children with disabilities. This survey was administered immediately before the first CTC payments went out and immediately after the payments ended
