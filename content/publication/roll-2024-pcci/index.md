    Project Community Connections, Inc. (PCCI) initiated a groundbreaking cash transfer program
    in 2022 to address the multifaceted challenges faced by individuals experiencing homelessness in
    Atlanta, GA. This innovative program distributed $400 monthly for 12 months to a randomly
    selected group of individuals experiencing housing insecurity, alongside essential rental, utility
    assistance, and caseworker support. The ongoing evaluation employs administrative data,
    spending data, longitudinal survey data, and qualitative interviews to explore the impacts of
    unconditional cash transfers on recipients' lives. This report presents the results of the programâ€™s
    pilot year, which enrolled 50 PCCI clients in the cash transfer program.
