abstract: |
  Economic insecurity remains a persistent challenge in the United States — especially for
  women in communities shaped by generations of disinvestment. In Her Hands (IHH) set out
  to address this challenge by delivering unconditional cash to women in neighborhoods with
  some of Georgia’s highest poverty rates.The program, designed with community members,
  distributed $20,400 over two years to 654 low-income women across urban, suburban,
  and rural settings. Findings suggest that the program enabled participants to stabilize
  their finances, invest in their futures and communities, and overcome systemic barriers
  to economic security and mobility.
