  In early 2021, Congress expanded the existing Child Tax Credit (CTC), increasing the credit’s maximum value (up to $3,000 for school-age children and $3,600 for children under the age of six). Half of the credit was issued monthly to most families from July to December 2021. The temporary expansion was further made fully refundable, meaning that for one year, even very low-income families qualified. In this study, we draw on a novel, multi-wave probability-based panel survey of more than 1,000 CTC recipients to understand the credit’s impact on families. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines logistic regression and qualitative content analysis, we find that most respondents reported that the CTC made it easier for them to support their families, afford utility bills, and cover housing costs. Over one-third of respondents also stated that the CTC allowed them to pay for extracurricular activities for their children and save for their child’s future education, and spend more time with their children. In open-ended responses, parents describe that the CTC had a generally positive effect: it helped with bills/utilities, allowed families to save, helped with groceries/food, covered necessities for children, and reduced stress for parents. Conversely, some reported that it had no effects or made no difference. We also assess how participant demographics and political affiliation are associated with each theme.
