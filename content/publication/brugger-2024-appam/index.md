abstract: |
  This study examines the relationship between FEMA’s National Risk Index (NRI)—a composite measure of disaster risk—and voter turnout in the 2020 United States Presidential Election across Los Angeles, Miami, and San Antonio. While prior research focuses on individual hazards, this study leverages a multidimensional risk index to assess how expected loss, social vulnerability, and community resilience interact with civic engagement. Our findings reveal significant spatial heterogeneity: the association between disaster risk and voter turnout varies across cities and within urban areas, shaped by localized patterns of vulnerability and resilience. These results highlight the need for place-based analyses to understand how environmental risk influences democratic participation in complex urban landscapes. By demonstrating the uneven civic implications of composite risk, this study informs policies aimed at strengthening political engagement in hazard-prone communities.
