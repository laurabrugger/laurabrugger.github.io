  Immigrant parents were less likely to have heard about the 2021 expanded child tax credit (CTC) than parents who were born in the United States, according to a recent survey conducted by      the Social Policy Institute at Washington University in St. Louis and Appalachian State University. Survey data collected from December 2021 through January 2022 also showed immigrant         parents were less likely to have received the credit compared to non-immigrant parents.
