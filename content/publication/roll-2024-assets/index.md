  Guaranteed income (GI) programs offer households a periodic, fixed, unconditional cash payment. These        programs are often targeted at households facing significant economic constraints due to low incomes or      economic marginalization. A recent systematic review of GI programs found improvements in recipients'        financial stability, education, health, and well-being (Rizvi et al., 2024). However, little research        explores the effect of these payments on asset-building and credit outcomes. In addition, there is limited   research on the extent to which these programs can help close racial wealth and credit gaps for groups—      such as Black individuals and families—that have faced historical and contemporary economic                  discrimination. These households often face a complex set of financial challenges that make building         savings difficult, including job instability (Shapiro, Meschede, & Osoro, 2013), poor credit access          (Ratcliffe & Brown, 2017), exposure to predatory lending (Haynes, 2022), exclusion from mainstream           financial services (Mullainathan & Shafir, 2009), and volatile income streams (Hardy, 2017). These           challenges can be exacerbated for women from economically marginalized groups, who have lower incomes, on    average, than their male counterparts (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020).
